# NONG Manager

## An easier way to manage NONG songs

# CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT COMPLETE

---

I think we can agree it's a pain in the ass to get find the download to the song on a random youtube video, get to the song in the files and replace it and then later down the line forget we had replaced it so when we play a level that actually uses the song we have to go back and fix it

## WELL THIS IS A PROBLEM NO MORE


Using this application you can have your NONG's easily swapped out and restored to the original song with ease without touching your file system once. It will even keep track of other levels using the same replacement song and flag them if you're trying to swap for both at the same time


The [website](https://garrettlee.ca/nongmanager) component keeps your local client updated with new levels being added to the database and allows you to view what levels are currently supported


> Currently this program is only supported on Windows
